Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Vuex and Firebase's realtime database.
This is definitely not finished product, since I have been creating this only for couple of days.
There is some bugs and styling is not finished. There are lot of plans for future improvement:
- responsiveness
- exercises are shown one by one / in smaller groups
- stats and graphs about your exercises
- login / user authentication
- map for locations
- some UX improvements
- other bug fixes
